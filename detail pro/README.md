# Detailing Website (GitHub Pages Ready)

This repo is a clean, original template inspired by common detailing website layouts (hero → services → about/why-us → pricing → gallery → reviews → contact).

## Files
- `index.html` (home)
- `about.html`
- `services.html`
- `gallery.html`
- `reviews.html`
- `contact.html`
- `privacy.html`
- `assets/css/styles.css`
- `assets/js/main.js`

## Customize
1. Open any HTML file and update:
   - business name
   - phone/email
   - hours + service area
   - prices + package details
2. Update brand colors in `assets/css/styles.css`:
   - `--accent` and `--accent2`
3. Replace placeholder gallery blocks with real images:
   - easiest: put images in `assets/img/` and use `<img src="assets/img/yourphoto.jpg" ...>`

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload these files.
2. In GitHub:
   - **Settings → Pages**
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
3. Wait for GitHub to publish your site, then open the provided URL.

## Forms / Booking
GitHub Pages is static, so forms need a provider:
- Link a Google Form
- Use Formspree
- Link a booking tool (Calendly, Square Appointments, etc.)

## Notes
- Don’t copy another company’s images/text/logo without permission.
- This template is meant to be customized for your own business.
